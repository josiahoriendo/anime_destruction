# anime_destruction

This is a project by Josiah Oriendo and Sujal Davhale.

The vision: Inspired by Nukemap, we hope to make a website that lets you see the destruction that is caused by popular anime and manga by letting you drag and drop a pin on any location. We hope to give you a visualizaiton of the types of destruction, as well as an aprox fatality count.

Technologies we will be using:
Front-end: React framework with HTML, CSS, and JS (or TypeScript)
Back-end: MongoDB or MySQL wih AWS. Framework not decided yet.

Anime we will be covering (not sure of specific events yet):
1. JJK
2. Attack on Titan
3. Chainsaw man
4. One Punch Man
5. Your Name
6. Mob Psyco

This list will change, and the initial rollout may not have all of the above.
